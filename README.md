# Neural-Machine-Translation-mini-project
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in the field of computational linguistics, significantly enhancing the quality and efficiency of language translation system .Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. 
This Woek focuses on leveraging the Helsinki-NLP's Opus-MT model for English to Hindi translation. Through this endeavor, we aim to explore the efficacy and limitations of neural machine translation techniques, particularly in the context of English-Hindi language pairs.
